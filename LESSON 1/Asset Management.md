Only one thing is essential for Unity, as with everything, you have to face your frustration, the learning curve is always uphill, if you are not ready, this is not for you. Other jobs await you, but less demanding. I will try to explain it with this diagram --->

```flow
st=>start: Unity
op2=>operation: Effort
op=>operation: Creativity
op3=>operation: Community manager
cond=>condition: Yes or Not?
e=>end: Success

st->op->op2->cond->cond->cond->op3
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op3
cond(no)->op3
```
